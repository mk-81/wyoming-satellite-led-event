        As explained above, dummy data must be sent after the last real colour
        information so that all of the data can reach its destination down the line.
        The delay is not as bad as with the human example above.
        It is only 1/2 bit per LED. This is because the SPI clock line
        needs to be inverted.

        Say a bit is ready on the SPI data line. The sender communicates
        this by toggling the clock line. The bit is read by the LED
        and immediately forwarded to the output data line. When the clock goes
        down again on the input side, the LED will toggle the clock up
        on the output to tell the next LED that the bit is ready.

        After one LED the clock is inverted, and after two LEDs it is in sync
        again, but one cycle behind. Therefore, for every two LEDs, one bit
        of delay gets accumulated. For 300 LEDs, 150 additional bits must be fed to
        the input of LED one so that the data can reach the last LED.

        Ultimately, we need to send additional numLEDs/2 arbitrary data bits,
        in order to trigger numLEDs/2 additional clock changes. This driver
        sends zeroes, which has the benefit of getting LED one partially or
        fully ready for the next update to the strip. An optimized version
        of the driver could omit the "clockStartFrame" method if enough zeroes have
        been sent as part of "clockEndFrame".
